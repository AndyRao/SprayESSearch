Http search service which fetch different kinds of data from Elasticsearch and return the data back to clients.

In this project I use three open source tools:
1) elastic4s which is a concise, idiomatic, asynchronous, type safe Scala Client for elasticsearch
2) spray which is used for building REST/HTTP-based integration layers on top of Scala and Akka
3) Akka which is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault tolerant event-driven applications on the JVM.
